# DIY-Loads-management-in-solar-off-grid-inverters-Voltronic-inverter-
This project is aimed to organise the process of connecting the power loads to the inverter output. The inductive loads will be connected and disconnected sequentially with certain delays. Also the high power load (water heater) could be connected to the inverter output by limiting the load current.
